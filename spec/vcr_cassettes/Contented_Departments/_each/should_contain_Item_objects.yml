        Content<\/strong><\/p><p>For structured content, summaries serve a specific
        purpose: They let readers know what the page contains and what a reader can
        expect to find. In structured introductions, avoid extraneous information
        (eg. \"Introduction\" as a heading) or marketing speak. For some users, the
        introduction is all they need to point them in the right direction.<\/p><p><strong>##
        Section<\/strong><\/p><p>Sections can be made up of a heading plus one or
        more paragraphs or other elements. Headings aren''t always necessary.<\/p><p>The
        defining characteristic of a section is that it\u2019s a standalone information
        chunk that can be reused outside of the article or document where it appears.<\/p><p>In
        our service content, pages are usually made up of several independent sections
        that address an aspect of the process or topic.<\/p><p><strong>## Numbered
        list<\/strong><\/p><p>Numbered lists, also called ordered lists, are used
        for writing out the steps of a process or listing items that need to go in
        a specific order.<\/p><p>They''re easiest to read when each item is parallel
        to the others. (To do: example)<\/p><p><strong>## Bulleted list<\/strong><\/p><p>Bulleted
        lists, also called unordered lists, are used to group items or ideas together.
        Like numbered lists, they''re easiest to read when written to be parallel.<\/p><p>Bulleted
        lists are a great way to break up paragraph text that has gotten too long
        or includes important information you don''t want readers to miss.<\/p><p>See
        an example of how replacing paragraphs with lists can improve the usability
        of content by making it easier for users to scan.<\/p><p><strong>## Note<\/strong><\/p><p>Notes
        are a way to include supplementary or related details that aren''t directly
        related to your main text.<\/p><p>&gt; The visual design of a note plays a
        huge role in its effectiveness. Banner blindness can cause users to ignore
        them, so be careful of using too many notes or making them stand out from
        the text too much.<\/p><p><strong>## Warning<\/strong><\/p><p>In guidance-type
        service page content, warnings alert users to crucial things to do or consider.
        They should be used even more sparingly than notes, and only when missing
        the information could cause really bad consequences for the user.<\/p><p>eg.\u00a0<\/p><p>&lt;p

        &lt;\/p&gt;<\/p><p><strong>## See Also<\/strong><\/p><p>Although dependent
        on the design of the page, related content section is helpful for providing

        Content<\/strong><\/p><p>For structured content, summaries serve a specific
        purpose: They let readers know what the page contains and what a reader can
        expect to find. In structured introductions, avoid extraneous information
        (eg. \"Introduction\" as a heading) or marketing speak. For some users, the
        introduction is all they need to point them in the right direction.<\/p><p><strong>##
        Section<\/strong><\/p><p>Sections can be made up of a heading plus one or

        defining characteristic of a section is that it\u2019s a standalone information
        chunk that can be reused outside of the article or document where it appears.<\/p><p>In
        our service content, pages are usually made up of several independent sections
        that address an aspect of the process or topic.<\/p><p><strong>## Numbered
        list<\/strong><\/p><p>Numbered lists, also called ordered lists, are used
        for writing out the steps of a process or listing items that need to go in
        a specific order.<\/p><p>They''re easiest to read when each item is parallel
        to the others. (To do: example)<\/p><p><strong>## Bulleted list<\/strong><\/p><p>Bulleted
        lists, also called unordered lists, are used to group items or ideas together.
        Like numbered lists, they''re easiest to read when written to be parallel.<\/p><p>Bulleted
        lists are a great way to break up paragraph text that has gotten too long
        or includes important information you don''t want readers to miss.<\/p><p>See
        an example of how replacing paragraphs with lists can improve the usability
        of content by making it easier for users to scan.<\/p><p><strong>## Note<\/strong><\/p><p>Notes
        are a way to include supplementary or related details that aren''t directly
        related to your main text.<\/p><p>&gt; The visual design of a note plays a
        huge role in its effectiveness. Banner blindness can cause users to ignore
        them, so be careful of using too many notes or making them stand out from
        the text too much.<\/p><p><strong>## Warning<\/strong><\/p><p>In guidance-type
        service page content, warnings alert users to crucial things to do or consider.
        They should be used even more sparingly than notes, and only when missing
        the information could cause really bad consequences for the user.<\/p><p>eg.\u00a0<\/p><p>&lt;p
