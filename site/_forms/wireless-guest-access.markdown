IMPORTANT INFORMATION. PLEASE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING.
nyuguest is a wireless network made available for NYU guests and visitors who do not have an NYU NetID and thus cannot connect to the regular NYURoam SSID of nyu. As a guest of Bobst Library, you may gain access to our nyuguest account and password by registering for it on the following page. A new password to access nyuguest becomes available every Monday morning around 9AM, at which point you will have to register for it again to obtain the new password.
To gain access to nyuguest, we must record your name, email, affiliation, and the MAC address of the device you wish to connect to nyuguest. We collect and use this information only to maintain the integrity and security of the service, and in no way use it for any other reason. The email you register is where the nyuguest account and password is sent to. The Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique value associated with your device network adapters and is also known as hardware address, a physical address or Wi-Fi address. MAC addresses are 12-digit hexadecimal numbers and are usually written XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX. There will be a series of letter and numbers (i.e. "A4-BA-DB-E8-2E-E1"). New York University (NYU) utilizes your device's MAC Address for authorization, authentication and non-repudiation purposes in the nyuguest Wireless Internet Gateway Network.
By registering for Bobst Guest Wireless access, you are agreeing to NYU's Policy on Responsible Use of NYU Computers and Data as an affiliate, which is defined in the policy. You can read the policy below:
