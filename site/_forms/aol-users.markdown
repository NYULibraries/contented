AOL Users Please Note!
Our system has experienced issues sending emails to AOL email accounts. This is due to incorrect or invalid emails being submitted. If an email is sent to an invalid or inactive AOL account, our servers are blocked for certain amount of time, preventing ALL AOL users from receiving the Guest Wireless Password.
If you have a different email address, we highly recommend using it instead to ensure that you receive the Guest Wireless Password email! We are working with AOL to fix this issue, but do not have a specific timeline for a possible fix. We apologize for any inconveniences.
