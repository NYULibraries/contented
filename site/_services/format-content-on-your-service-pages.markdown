title: Format Content on Your Service Pages
---

# Service Page Title

Titles usually display on the page as well as inside the HTML `<title>` tag, for consistency and search engine findability. Front-load the title with an action verb describing what the user needs to do. We write for international audiences, so titles never include gerunds. We generally avoid the "How to … " format because it makes titles harder to scan in search results.

# Summary Content

For structured content, summaries serve a specific purpose: They let readers know what the page contains and what a reader can expect to find. Users will be coming to a service page looking for an answer to a question. If you have a simple answer to a question, put it in the summary. Avoid extraneous information or marketing speak.

# Section

Sections can be made up of a heading plus one or more paragraphs or other elements. Headings aren't always necessary, but if you use them, remember to front-load them with information.

Don't use:
* questions
* technical terms unless you’ve already explained them
* ‘introduction’ as your first section – users don’t want an introduction, just give the most important information

The defining characteristic of a section is that it’s a standalone information chunk that can be reused outside of the article or document where it appears.

In our service content, pages are usually made up of several independent sections that address an aspect of the process or topic.

# Numbered list

Numbered lists, also called ordered lists, are used for writing out the steps of a process or listing items that need to go in a specific order.

They're easiest to read when each item is parallel to the others. (To do: example)

# Bulleted list

Bulleted lists, also called unordered lists, are used to group items or ideas together. Like numbered lists, they're easiest to read when written to be parallel.

Bulleted lists are a great way to break up paragraph text that has gotten too long or includes important information you don't want readers to miss.

## Examples
See an example of how replacing paragraphs with lists can improve the usability of content by making it easier for users to scan.

### Good example

At the activity center you can:
* swim
* play
* run

### Bad example

At the activity center: 
* you can swim
* you can play
* you can run

# Note

Notes are a way to include supplementary or related details that aren't directly related to your main text. 

> **Note:** The visual design of a note plays a huge role in its effectiveness. Banner blindness can cause users to ignore them, so be careful of using too many notes or making them stand out from the text too much.

# Warning

In guidance-type service page content, warnings alert users to crucial things to do or consider. They should be used even more sparingly than notes, and only when missing the information could cause really bad consequences for the user.

eg. 
<p class="message"> Before you start: Make sure you have the appropriate access permissions to use the <a href="http://library.nyu.edu/services/digital-studio-access-privileges">Data Services Studio,</a></p>


# See Also

Although dependent on the design of the page, a _See Also_ section at the end of an article is helpful for providing supplementary links, local navigation to FAQs, or brief related content. This section can sometimes be replaced with the _Quick Links_ in the page sidebar, or with a _warning_ alert instead.
