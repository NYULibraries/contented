title: Fines â€“ Bern Dibner Library
---

If you're late returning materials you've borrowed from the Dibner Library, you're subject to overdue fines. We'll send you an email notice when an item becomes overdue, but it's your responsibility to be aware of due dates.

## How to Pay Fines
Fines may be paid in cash at the Service Desk. Fines in excess of $30.00 and overdue books not returned by the end of the semester will result in a block on your account and prevent you from registering for classes or graduating until your account is cleared.
