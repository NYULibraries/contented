**Before you begin: A note on service page titles**

Titles usually display on the page as well as inside the HTML `<title>` tag, for consistency and search engine findability. Titles begin with an action verb describing what the user needs to do. We write for international audiences, so titles never include gerunds. We avoid the ""How to …"" format because it makes titles hard to scan in search results.

## Introduction

In unstructured content, introductions vary from catchy attention-grabbers to organized summaries. For structured content, introductions serve a more specific purpose: They let readers know what the page contains and what a reader can expect to find. In structured introductions, avoid extraneous information or marketing speak. For some users, the introduction is all they need to point them in the right direction.

## Section

Sections can be made up of a heading plus one or more paragraphs or other elements. Headings aren't always necessary.

The defining characteristic of a section is that it’s a standalone information chunk that can be reused outside of the article or document where it appears.

In our educational content, help articles are usually made up of several independent sections that address an aspect of the process or topic.

## Numbered list

Numbered lists, also called ordered lists, are used for writing out the steps of a process or listing items that need to go in a specific order.

They're easiest to read when each item is parallel to the others. (To do: example)

## Bulleted list

Bulleted lists, also called unordered lists, are used to group items or ideas together. Like numbered lists, they're easiest to read when written to be parallel.

Bulleted lists are a great way to break up paragraph text that has gotten too long or includes important information you don't want readers to miss.

See an example of how replacing paragraphs with lists can improve the usability of content by making it easier for users to scan.

## Note

Notes are a way to include supplementary or related details that aren't directly related to your main text.

The visual design of a note plays a huge role in its effectiveness. Banner blindness can cause users to ignore them, so be careful of using too many notes or making them stand out from the text too much.

## Warning

In technical or educational content, warnings alert users to crucial things to do or consider. They should be used even more sparingly than notes, and only when missing the information could cause really bad consequences for the user.
