# What We Do

We acquire materials in the history of labor, radicalism, and progressive social movements and provide access to these materials by assisting people with their research questions. Tamiment/Wagner also includes the Frederick Ewen Academic Freedom Center, the Center for the United States and the Cold War, and the Archives of Irish America. We also sponsor forums, seminars, and other public events related to our collections and programs.
