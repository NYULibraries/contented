# What We Do

We help scholars create, use, store, and share multimedia (video, audio, text, images) for their research, teaching, and learning. Scholars work hands-on with Digital Studio hardware, software, and online tools to accomplish their projects. We train users on the tools and software to accomplish their work, and we consult on best practices, project scoping and design.
