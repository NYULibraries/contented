Home for the assets and templates for the NYU Division of Libraries [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/) website to replace [http://library.nyu.edu](http://library.nyu.edu).

## Siteleaf

The website uses Siteleaf as its CMS, where access can be controlled, content can be written in Markdown or plain text, and the static pages generated can be hosted in the cloud. Publishing these pages to GitHub allows us to use our established practice of coding in the open and using continuous integration and rapid deployment.

## Templates

We are in the process of developing the [Liquid templates](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) necessary for translating our style guide into an active design.

## Assets

Before pushing our style and javascript assets up to our Siteleaf theme we can automate the process of precompiling since we use [a custom Compass plugin](https://github.com/NYULibraries/nyulibraries-assets) to manage our global assets.
